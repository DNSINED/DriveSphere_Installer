1. Reassembly Using 7-Zip
If your files are split using 7-Zip (e.g., myfile.zip.001, myfile.zip.002):

Install 7-Zip: Download and install it from 7-Zip's official website.
Ensure all parts are in the same folder.
Right-click on the first file (myfile.zip.001).
Choose 7-Zip > Extract Here or Extract to "myfile/".
7-Zip will automatically locate and combine the other parts.
The original file (e.g., myfile.zip or myfile.exe) will be extracted.

2. Reassembly Using WinRAR
If your files are split using WinRAR (e.g., myfile.part1.rar, myfile.part2.rar):

Install WinRAR: Download and install it from WinRAR's official website.
Ensure all parts are in the same folder.
Right-click on the first file (myfile.part1.rar).
Choose Extract Here or Extract to "myfile/".
WinRAR will automatically combine the parts and extract the original file.

3. Reassembly Using Command Prompt for Split Files
If your files are split using split (e.g., part_aa, part_ab):

Open Command Prompt:
Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Navigate to the folder containing the split files:
cmd
Copy code
cd path\to\your\folder
Use the copy command to merge the parts:
cmd
Copy code
copy /b part_aa+part_ab+part_ac myfile.zip
Extract the merged .zip file using 7-Zip or WinRAR.

Important Notes:
Ensure File Order: Ensure the parts are named sequentially and located in the same directory before attempting reassembly.
If the file is .zip, users need an archive tool (7-Zip or WinRAR) to extract it after reassembly.
If the file is .exe, users can directly run it after reassembly.
